        As a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the HPRU-GI/Darby lab, I currently perform genomic and bioinformatic research on Gastrointestinal Infections. I work primarily on a large data set of shotgun metagenomics data (~2000 samples) collected by the HPRU-GI and the INTEGRATE Project (www.integrateproject.org.uk) from cases of diarrhoea, the majority of which remain unexplained when using non-genomic methodologies. The primary aims of this research are:
        
        i)	to investigate to overlap of diagnostics achieved by metagenomic sequencing, with that of culturing and molecular (PCR) methodologies, for the identification known pathogens
        
        ii)	to identify novel pathogens where conventional species of interest (e.g. E. coli, Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Norovirus) are not detected.
