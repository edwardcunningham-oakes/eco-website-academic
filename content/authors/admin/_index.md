<div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="3">

I am a postdoctoral bioinformatician,  gamer,  [powerlifter](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/m/welshpa/1801/by-ipf-points) and father of one, based in Liverpool.

I completed my PhD at Cardiff University, looking at the genomics of bacteria with tolerance and resistance to industrial preservatives (see my [most recent review](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnaa010) on this topic). Recently, I have been working on metagenomics and novel pathogen identification in unexplained diarrhoeal disease.

I am always open to meet and/or collaborate, so if there is anything you would like to discuss, get in touch.</div></font>
