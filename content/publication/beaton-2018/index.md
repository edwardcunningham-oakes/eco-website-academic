abstract: Pseudomonas baetica strain a390T is the type strain of this recently described
  species and here we present its high-contiguity draft genome. To celebrate the 16th
  International Conference on Pseudomonas, the genome of P. baetica strain a390T was
  sequenced using a unique combination of Ion Torrent semiconductor and Oxford Nanopore
  methods as part of a collaborative community-led project. The use of high-quality
  Ion Torrent sequences with long Nanopore reads gave rapid, high-contiguity and -quality,
  16-contig genome sequence. Whole genome phylogenetic analysis places P. baetica
  within the P. koreensis clade of the P. fluorescens group. Comparison of the main
  genomic features of P. baetica with a variety of other Pseudomonas spp. suggests
  that it is a highly adaptable organism, typical of the genus. This strain was originally
  isolated from the liver of a diseased wedge sole fish, and genotypic and phenotypic
  analyses show that it is tolerant to osmotic stress and to oxytetracycline.
