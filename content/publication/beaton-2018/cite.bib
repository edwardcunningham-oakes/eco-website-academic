 abstract = {Pseudomonas baetica strain a390T is the type strain of this recently described species and here we present its high-contiguity draft genome. To celebrate the 16th International Conference on Pseudomonas, the genome of P. baetica strain a390T was sequenced using a unique combination of Ion Torrent semiconductor and Oxford Nanopore methods as part of a collaborative community-led project. The use of high-quality Ion Torrent sequences with long Nanopore reads gave rapid, high-contiguity and -quality, 16-contig genome sequence. Whole genome phylogenetic analysis places P. baetica within the P. koreensis clade of the P. fluorescens group. Comparison of the main genomic features of P. baetica with a variety of other Pseudomonas spp. suggests that it is a highly adaptable organism, typical of the genus. This strain was originally isolated from the liver of a diseased wedge sole fish, and genotypic and phenotypic analyses show that it is tolerant to osmotic stress and to oxytetracycline.},
