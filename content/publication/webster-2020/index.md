abstract: Bacterial endophytes are found in the internal tissues of plants and have
  intimate associations with their host. However, little is known about the diversity
  of medicinal plant endophytes (ME) or their capability to produce specialised metabolites
  that may contribute to therapeutic properties. We isolated 75 bacterial ME from
  24 plant species of the Western Ghats, India. Molecular identification by 16S rRNA
  gene sequencing grouped MEs into 13 bacterial genera, with members of Gammaproteobacteria
  and Firmicutes being the most abundant. To improve taxonomic identification, 26
  selected MEs were genome sequenced and average nucleotide identity (ANI) used to
  identify them to the species-level. This identified multiple species in the most
  common genus as Bacillus. Similarly, identity of the Enterobacterales was also distinguished
  within Enterobacter and Serratia by ANI and core-gene analysis. AntiSMASH identified
  non-ribosomal peptide synthase, lantipeptide and bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters
  (BGC) as the most common BGCs found in the ME genomes. A total of five of the ME
  isolates belonging to Bacillus, Serratia and Enterobacter showed antimicrobial activity
  against the plant pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum. Using molecular and genomic
  approaches we have characterised a unique collection of endophytic bacteria from
  medicinal plants. Their genomes encode multiple specialised metabolite gene clusters
  and the collection can now be screened for novel bioactive and medicinal metabolites.
