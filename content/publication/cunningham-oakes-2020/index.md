abstract: <p align="justify"> In order to expand the limited understanding of the genomics of antimicrobial-resistant industrial bacteria, we report the genome sequence of Pluralibacter gergoviae ECO77, a historical contaminant strain of industrial origin. The multireplicon 6.16-Mbp genome of ECO77 consists of a 5.37-Mbp main chromosome, a megaplasmid (605,666â€‰bp), and a large plasmid (182,007 bp). </p>
